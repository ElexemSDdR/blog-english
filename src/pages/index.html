				<p>
					Hi!! We're Jocelyn, Estefania and Valentín. We had eat sushi for the first time and we loved it, so-so, but it was a bit crazy experience, and we wanna share it with you. So we're gonna tell you about our experience and our
					story.

			<h2>Our experience</h2>
			<div class="experience-container">
				<article class="tour">
					<p>
						All starts when we were thinking about meet us and taste the sushi, especially for Estefania that never had
						eaten it before, so we decided to meet us and try it.
					</p>
					<p>
						We meet us at my home (Valentín's home), in the moment we made a bit of homework, and after that, we order the sushi 'cause later we were gonna go to pick up the order to the local and finally try it.
					</p>
					<p>
						Before we go to the place, we have been talking about some paranormal experiences that we lived, and it was night; so when we were going to the local we were afraid 'cause everything was dark and we had been talking about stranger thing. But later we forgot that and we arrived to the local.
					</p>

						<p>
							The local was so pretty and a bit small inside, but it looks really nice and clean. The girl who attended us was very kind and good to us. She was well dressed for cooking, protecting well that her hair does not fall out, that her hands are clean, and she also had an apron to avoid dirtying her clothes.
						</p>
						<p>
							The local outside was so pretty as well, it had a decoration that seems a japanese restaurant, with a poster of its instagram photo (that also it's a japanese girl); some windows that remind us the windows of Japan or similars and a little garden with a swing and some plants that decorate it and make it looks very well. Basicly, it was a nice place to buy or eat sushi.

						<p>
							When we arrived at my home, we finally could taste the sushi. We were so excited to try it, so we did it.
						</p>
						<p>
							We used the chopsticks to eat the sushi but is a bit difficult to do it, because that Jocelyn and Estefania ate the sushi with their hands and forks, and I could use the chopstick and then we tried it.
						</p>
						<p>
							We tried the sushi and we loved it, except Estefania, she wasn't like the sushi. She tried different types of sushi like sushi with coocked salmon, others with avocado, others without rice, others with kiwi, but she wasn't like any of those, only one fried sushi and not at all. But Jocelyn and Valentín (me) loved the sushi, we ate all the pieces, for us it was so delicious. We also tried those with the soja and the bittersweet sauce and it was so good.
						</p>
						<p>
							We recommend you go to Tamashi and try the sushi, it's really really good and delicious.
							You can find them at Antártida Argentina 308, Esquel 9200 and also watch its instagram <a href="https://www.instagram.com/tamashi.esquel/">tamashi.esquel</a>.
